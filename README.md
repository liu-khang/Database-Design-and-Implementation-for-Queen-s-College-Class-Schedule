# Database-Design-and-Implementation-for-Queen-s-College-Class-Schedule

The goal of this project was to design and implement a SQL database for Queen's college class schedule with a team of people. This included creating new tables 
for the database (class building location, the class name, the course name, the department of the class, the instructor of the class, the class's mode of 
instruction, the class's room location, the department of the class's instructor, etc.), coming up with custom queries for said database, and creating an ERD chart
for the SQL database.

My role in this project was the project lead. My duties as project lead included assigning tasks to each member of the team, giving each member deadlines for 
the tasks they were assigned, and setting up meetings with each member for progress updates or any concerns regarding their assignments.
